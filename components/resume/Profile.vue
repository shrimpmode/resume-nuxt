        <div class="text-lg">
            I've been working as a software engineer for about 5 years. I love building applications and learning
            new technologies.
            I am a fast learner, innovative and flexible person. During my career I have worked in Front End, and
            Back End with technologies
            such as React, Vue, Django, Postgres, Typescript, Javascript, Python, and more.
